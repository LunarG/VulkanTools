# Layer Description and Status

## Overview

Layer libraries can be written to intercept or hook VK entry points for various
debug and validation purposes.  One or more VK entry points can be defined in your Layer
library.  Undefined entrypoints in the Layer library will be passed to the next Layer which
may be the driver.  Multiple layer libraries can be chained (actually a hierarchy) together.
vkEnumerateInstanceLayerProperties and vkEnumerateDeviceLayerProperties can be called to list the
available layers and their properties. Layers can intercept Vulkan instance level entry points
in which case they are called an Instance Layer.  Layers can intercept device entry  points
in which case they are called a Device Layer. Instance level entry points are those with VkInstance
or VkPhysicalDevice as first parameter.  Device level entry points are those with VkDevice, VkCommandBuffer,
or VkQueue as the first parameter. Layers that want to intercept both instance and device
level entrypoints are called Global Layers. vkXXXXGetProcAddr is used internally by the Layers and
Loader to initialize dispatch tables. Device Layers are activated at vkCreateDevice time. Instance
Layers are activated at vkCreateInstance time.  Layers can also be activated via environment variables
(VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS or VK_DEVICE_LAYERS).

### Layer library example code

Note that some layers are code-generated and will therefore exist in the directory (build_dir)/layers

-include/vkLayer.h  - header file for layer code.

### Templates
layers/basic.cpp (name=VK_LAYER_LUNARG_basic) simple example wrapping a few entrypoints. Shows layer features:
- Multiple dispatch tables for supporting multiple GPUs.
- Example layer extension function shown.
- Layer extension advertised by vkGetXXXExtension().

layers/multi.cpp (name=VK_LAYER_LUNARG_multi1:VK_LAYER_LUNARG_multi2) simple example showing multiple layers per library

(build dir)/layer/generic_layer.cpp (name=VK_LAYER_LUNARG_generic) - auto generated example wrapping all VK entrypoints.

### Print API Calls and Parameter Values
(build dir)/layers/api_dump.cpp (name=VK_LAYER_LUNARG_api_dump) - print out API calls along with parameter values

## Using Layers

1. Build VK loader using normal steps (cmake and make)
2. Place libVkLayer_<name>.so in the same directory as your VK test or app:

    cp build/layer/libVkLayer_basic.so build/layer/libVkLayer_generic.so build/tests

    This is required for the Loader to be able to scan and enumerate your library.
    Alternatively, use the VK\_LAYER\_PATH environment variable to specify where the layer libraries reside.

3. Create a vk_layer_settings.txt file in the same directory to specify how your layers should behave.

    Model it after the following example:  [*vk_layer_settings.txt*](vk_layer_settings.txt)

4. Specify which Layers to activate by using
vkCreateDevice and/or vkCreateInstance or environment variables.

    export VK\_INSTANCE\_LAYERS=VK_LAYER_LUNARG_basic:VK_LAYER_LUNARG_generic
    export VK\_DEVICE\_LAYERS=VK_LAYER_LUNARG_basic:VK_LAYER_LUNARG_generic
    cd build/tests; ./vkinfo

## Tips for writing new layers

1. Must implement vkGetInstanceProcAddr() (aka GIPA) and vkGetDeviceProcAddr() (aka GDPA);
2. Must have a local dispatch table to call next layer (see vk_layer.h);
3. Must have a layer manifest file for each Layer library for Loader to find layer properties (see loader/README.md)
4. Next layers GXPA can be found in the wrapped instance or device object;
5. Loader calls a layer's GXPA first so initialization should occur here;
6. all entrypoints can be wrapped but only will be called after layer is activated
    via the first vkCreatDevice or vkCreateInstance;
7. entrypoint names can be any name as specified by the layers vkGetXXXXXProcAddr
    implementation; exceptions are vkGetXXXXProcAddr,
    which must have the correct name since the Loader calls these entrypoints;
8. entrypoint names must be exported to the OSes dynamic loader with VK\_LAYER\_EXPORT;
9. Layer naming convention is camel case same name as in library: libVkLayer_<name>.so
10. For multiple layers in one library the manifest file can specify each layer.
