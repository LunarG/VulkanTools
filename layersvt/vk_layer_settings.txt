# This is an example vk_layer_settings.txt file.
#  This file allows for per-layer settings which can dynamically affect layer
#  behavior. Comments in this file are denoted with the "#" char.
#  Settings lines are of the form "<LayerIdentifier>.<SettingName> = <SettingValue>"
#
#  <LayerIdentifier> is typically the official layer name, minus the VK_LAYER prefix
#  and all lower-camel-case -- i.e., for VK_LAYER_LUNARG_api_dump, the layer
#  identifier is 'lunarg_api_dump'.
#
#
#  VK_LUNARG_LAYER_api_dump Settings:
#  ==================================
#
#    DETAILED:
#    =============
#    <LayerIdentifer>.detailed : Setting this to TRUE causes parameter details
#    to be dumped in addition to API calls
lunarg_api_dump.detailed = TRUE
#    NO_ADDR:
#    =============
#    <LayerIdentifier>.no_addr : Setting this to TRUE causes "address" to be
#    dumped in place of hex addresses
lunarg_api_dump.no_addr = FALSE
#    FILE:
#    =============
#    <LayerIdentifer>.file : Setting this to TRUE indicates that output
#    should be written to file instead of STDOUT
lunarg_api_dump.file = FALSE
#    LOG_FILENAME:
#    =============
#    <LayerIdentifer>.log_filename : Specifies the file to dump to when
#    "file = TRUE".  The default is "vk_apidump.txt"
lunarg_api_dump.log_filename = stdout
#    FLUSH:
#    =============
#    <LayerIdentifier>.flush : Setting this to TRUE causes IO to be flushed after
#    each line that's written
lunarg_api_dump.flush = FALSE
