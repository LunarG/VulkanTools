# Output Range
# =====================
# <LayerIdentifier>.output_range
# Comma separated list of frames to output or a range of frames with a start,
# count, and optional interval separated by a dash. A count of 0 will output
# every frame after the start of the range. Example: "5-8-2" will output frame
# 5, continue until frame 13, dumping every other frame. Example: "3,8-2" will
# output frames 3, 8, and 9.

# =====================

# =====================

# Specifies the number of spaces that a tab is equal to

# Frames
# =====================
# <LayerIdentifier>.frames
# Specifies list of frames to output as screenshots. It is specified as a
# comma-separated list of frames or a range of frames with a start, count, and
# optional interval separated by a dash. Setting the variable to "all" will
# output every frame. Example: "5-8-2" will output frame 5, continue until frame
# 13, dumping every other frame. Example: "3,8-2" will output frames 3, 8, and
# 9. If it is not set or it set to an empty string, no screenshots are created.

# =====================

# Specifies the directory in which to create the screenshot files. If it is not
# set or is set to an empty string, the files will be created in the current
# working directory.

# Format
# =====================
# <LayerIdentifier>.format
# Specify a color space for the output. If it is not set, set to null, or set to
# USE_SWAPCHAIN_COLORSPACE the format will be set to use the same color space as
# the swapchain object.
