Description: LunarG Vulkan Installation Analyzer
 VIA is a tool that can:
 1. Determine the state of Vulkan components on your system
 2. Validate that your Vulkan Loader and drivers are installed properly
 3. Capture your system state in a form that can be used as an attachment
    when submitting bugs

Description: LunarG GUI tool to configure Vulkan layers
 The Vulkan configuration tool is a graphical application that allows a user to
 specify which layers will be loaded by Vulkan applications at runtime. It
 provides an alternative to setting layers through environment variables or an
 application's layer selection. In addition, it allows using layers from non-
 standard locations, selecting the ordering for implicit layers, and specifying
 settings for layers that vkconfig supports.
