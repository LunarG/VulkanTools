 * application is running. The most obvious and slightly "faster"
 * approach would be to used QSharedMemory, however shared memory
 * is not freed if the app crashes. The trade off here is a slight
 * startup delay (500ms) to check if a local server is already
 * running. This is 100% robust from an application crash on all
 * platforms.
